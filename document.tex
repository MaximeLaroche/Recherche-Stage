\opening{Hello,}


I am writing to inquire about the opening developer intern.\\
 I have experience in data collection and visualization from a previous internship at bombardier. Ultimately, I love math and want to pursue a career in data science or AI, which is why this company sounds very fulfilling. I must admit I do not have experience in AI, which is why I am applying a developer: I want to learn!\\
I welcome the opportunity to speak with you for this or any other related positions.

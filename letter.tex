\opening{Hello,}


I am writing to offer my services as a design engineer.

I have industry experience in task automation from a previous internship at Bombardier aviation. Data had to be periodically mined from emails to analyze what tasks are the most problematic to employees and overall profitability. The data then needed to be manipulated to be comprehensible to a human.

I was previously an electrical engineering student. I changed paths because software interested me most. However, I think that my background in electrical engineering can help better understand what is implemented in the context of helping a microchip company.

I would appreciate the opportunity to have a conversation with you to discuss the position in further detail.
